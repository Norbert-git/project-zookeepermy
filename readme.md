# Project ZooKeeper

##Welcome to the Jungle
Our goal for Project Two is to create a simple zoo management app that is informative, useful, and - if it all possible - fun. It will allow keepers to coordinate with each other and keep track of their enclosures and the animals within them.

###The Tech
Project Zookeeper will utilize:
* Express
* Node.js
* Mongoose
* MongoDB Atlas
* Javascript
* HTML5
* CSS
